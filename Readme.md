### Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive 3D TV room scene using custom shaders, dynamic lighting, and user interaction. The scene showcases realistic textures, animations, and a variety of features designed to enhance the visual experience.

### Project Requirements

The project requires the implementation of:

- Custom shaders to enhance light interactions with materials and surfaces.
- A realistic lighting system providing illumination and shadows.
- Perspective projection for depth perception.
- Textured 3D objects (TV screen, stand, etc.) to achieve realism.
- Animations for dynamic content display on the TV screen.
- Mouse and keyboard interactions for user navigation and light adjustment.

### Software Platform

- **Three.js**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- **GLTFLoader:** Used to load 3D models in GLTF format
